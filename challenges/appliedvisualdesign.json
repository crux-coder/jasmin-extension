The default layout of elements in this way is called the <dfn>normal flow</dfn> of a document, but CSS offers the position property to override it.</p>\n<p>When the position of an element is set to <code>relative</code>, it allows you to specify how CSS should move it <em>relative</em> to its current position in the normal flow of the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of <code>left</code> or <code>right</code>, and <code>top</code> or <code>bottom</code>.

    "description": "\n<p>Color theory and its impact on design is a deep topic and only the basics are covered in the following challenges. On a website, color can draw attention to content, evoke emotions, or create visual harmony. Using different combinations of colors can really change the look of a website, and a lot of thought can go into picking a color palette that works with your content.</p>\n<p>The color wheel is a useful tool to visualize how colors relate to each other - it's a circle where similar hues are neighbors and different hues are farther apart. When two colors are opposite each other on the wheel, they are called complementary colors. They have the characteristic that if they are combined, they \"cancel\" each other out and create a gray color. However, when placed side-by-side, these colors appear more vibrant and produce a strong visual contrast.</p>\n<p>Some examples of complementary colors with their hex codes are:</p>\n<blockquote>red (#FF0000) and cyan (#00FFFF)<br>green (#00FF00) and magenta (#FF00FF)<br>blue (#0000FF) and yellow (#FFFF00)</blockquote>\n<p>This is different than the outdated RYB color model that many of us were taught in school, which has different primary and complementary colors. Modern color theory uses the additive RGB model (like on a computer screen) and the subtractive CMY(K) model (like in printing). Read <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_model\">here</a> for more information on this complex subject.</p>\n<p>There are many color picking tools available online that have an option to find the complement of a color.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Using color can be a powerful way to add visual interest to a page. However, color alone should not be used as the only way to convey important information because users with visual impairments may not understand that content. This issue will be covered in more detail in the Applied Accessibility challenges.</p>\n",

    "description": "\n<p>Computer monitors and device screens create different colors by combining amounts of red, green, and blue light. This is known as the RGB additive color model in modern color theory. Red (R), green (G), and blue (B) are called primary colors. Mixing two primary colors creates the secondary colors cyan (G + B), magenta (R + B) and yellow (R + G). You saw these colors in the Complementary Colors challenge. These secondary colors happen to be the complement to the primary color not used in their creation, and are opposite to that primary color on the color wheel. For example, magenta is made with red and blue, and is the complement to green.</p>\n<p>Tertiary colors are the result of combining a primary color with one of its secondary color neighbors. For example, within the RGB color model, red (primary) and yellow (secondary) make orange (tertiary). This adds six more colors to a simple color wheel for a total of twelve.</p>\n<p>There are various methods of selecting different colors that result in a harmonious combination in design. One example that can use tertiary colors is called the split-complementary color scheme. This scheme starts with a base color, then pairs it with the two colors that are adjacent to its complement. The three colors provide strong visual contrast in a design, but are more subtle than using two complementary colors.</p>\n<p>Here are three colors created using the split-complement scheme:</p>\n<table class=\"table table-striped\"><thead><tr><th>Color</th><th>Hex Code</th></tr></thead><thead></thead><tbody><tr><td>orange</td><td>#FF7F00</td></tr><tr><td>cyan</td><td>#00FFFF</td></tr><tr><td>raspberry</td><td>#FF007F</td></tr></tbody></table>\n",

If you picture a spectrum of colors starting with red on the left, moving through green in the middle, and blue on right, the hue is where a color fits along this line.

Recall that the 's' and 'l' of <code>hsl()</code> stand for saturation and lightness, respectively.

If you compare this to a movie, the CSS properties for 0% is how the element displays in the opening scene.

    "description": "\n<p>The last challenge introduced the <code>animation-timing-function</code> property and a few keywords that change the speed of an animation over its duration. CSS offers an option other than keywords that provides even finer control over how the animation plays out, through the use of Bezier curves.</p>\n<p>In CSS animations, Bezier curves are used with the <code>cubic-bezier</code> function. The shape of the curve represents how the animation plays out. The curve lives on a 1 by 1 coordinate system. The X-axis of this coordinate system is the duration of the animation (think of it as a time scale), and the Y-axis is the change in the animation.</p>\n<p>The <code>cubic-bezier</code> function consists of four main points that sit on this 1 by 1 grid: <code>p0</code>, <code>p1</code>, <code>p2</code>, and <code>p3</code>. <code>p0</code> and <code>p3</code> are set for you - they are the beginning and end points which are always located respectively at the origin (0, 0) and (1, 1). You set the x and y values for the other two points, and where you place them in the grid dictates the shape of the curve for the animation to follow. This is done in CSS by declaring the x and y values of the <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> \"anchor\" points in the form: <code>(x1, y1, x2, y2)</code>. Pulling it all together, here's an example of a Bezier curve in CSS code:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token property\">animation-timing-function</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">cubic-bezier</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>0.25<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 0.25<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 0.75<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 0.75<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the example above, the x and y values are equivalent for each point (x1 = 0.25 = y1 and x2 = 0.75 = y2), which if you remember from geometry class, results in a line that extends from the origin to point (1, 1). This animation is a linear change of an element during the length of an animation, and is the same as using the <code>linear</code> keyword. In other words, it changes at a constant speed.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "\n<p>For the element with the id of <code>ball1</code>, change the value of the <code>animation-timing-function</code> property from <code>linear</code> to its equivalent <code>cubic-bezier</code> function value. Use the point values given in the example above.</p>\n"

On the right, the difference between the <code>ease-out</code> keyword (for the blue element) and <code>linear</code> keyword (for the red element) is demonstrated. Similar animation progressions to the <code>ease-out</code> keyword can be achieved by using a custom cubic Bezier curve function.</p>\n<p>In general, changing the <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> anchor points drives the creation of different Bezier curves, which controls how the animation progresses through time. Here's an example of a Bezier curve using values to mimic the ease-out style:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token property\">animation-timing-function</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">cubic-bezier</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>0<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 0<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 0.58<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 1<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Remember that all <code>cubic-bezier</code> functions start with <code>p0</code> at (0, 0) and end with <code>p3</code> at (1, 1). In this example, the curve moves faster through the Y-axis (starts at 0, goes to <code>p1</code> y value of 0, then goes to <code>p2</code> y value of 1) than it moves through the X-axis (0 to start, then 0 for <code>p1</code>, up to 0.58 for <code>p2</code>). As a result, the change in the animated element progresses faster than the time of the animation for that segment. Towards the end of the curve, the relationship between the change in x and y values reverses - the y value moves from 1 to 1 (no change), and the x values move from 0.58 to 1, making the animation changes progress slower compared to the animation duration.</p>\n",
